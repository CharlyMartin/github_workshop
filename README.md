# git & Github workshop

This is the repository for the git & GitHub workshop of [Le Wagon Sydney](https://www.lewagon.com/sydney). Our list of workshops is available on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Le-Wagon-Sydney-Coding-Bootcamp/).

### instructions
If you're reading this, it means you've been able to successfully clone the
repository from my GitHub account on your laptop. Congrats 👏

Create a new branch using git to update this file locally: add your team
name to the list below. If you don't have one, make one up 😁

Finally, push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request. When it's done, let me know and I'll review your code first and accept it, or not... 😉

If successful, your names will be here for eternity, among the GitHub legends. Happy collaborating :sunglasses:
