<h1>Collaborating with Github</h1>

<p class="congrats!">
  If you're reading this, it means you've been able to successfully clone the
  repository from my GitHub account on your laptop. Congrats 👏
</p>

<p class="git instructions">
  Now create a new branch using git to update this file locally: add your team
  name to the list below. If you don't have one, make one up 😁
</p>

<!-- ADD YOUR TEAM NAME BETWEEN <li> tags-->
<ul class="team-names">
  <li></li>
</ul>
<!-- DON'T DELETE PREVIOUS TEAM NAMES THOUGH! -->

<p class="GitHub instructions">
  Finally, push your branch to GitHub to be able to create a Pull Request.
  When it's done, let me know and I'll review your code first and accept
  it, or not... 😉
