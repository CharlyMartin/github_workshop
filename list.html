<h1>Collaborating with Github</h1>

<p class="congrats!">
  If you're reading this, it means you've been able to successfully clone the
  repository from my GitHub account on your laptop. Congrats 👏

<p class="git instructions">
  Now create a new branch using git to update this file locally: add your team
  name to the list below. If you don't have one, make one up 😁
</p>

<!-- ADD YOUR TEAM NAME BETWEEN <li> tags-->
<ul class="team-names">
  <li></li>
</ul>
<!-- DON'T DELETE PREVIOUS TEAM NAMES THOUGH! -->

<p class="GitHub instructions">
  Finally, push your branch on GitHub and create a Pull Request for me to accept
  it. Or not, I will check the quality of your code first 😉
